  geokube is an open source Python package for geoscience
  data analysis that provides the user with a simple
  application programming interface (API) for performing
  geospatial operations (e.g., extracting a bounding box or
  regridding) and temporal operations (e.g., resampling) on
  different types of scientific feature types like grids,
  profiles and points, using xarray data structures and
  xarray ecosystem frameworks such as xesmf.
